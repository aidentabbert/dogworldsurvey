Last night I dreamt that Faith Reid needed me and I slept by her side, and when that was done she disappeared. I gave me a slight feeling of dread, more like anxiety than depression, and although it was slight it felt like it could send me into a panic attack. I also broke my glasses in the dream. I don't really get why I had this dream; I thought I got over my loneliness, but I guess not. Some feeling deep inside me must know I'm lying to myself or something. I wish it would just be one way or the other, but maybe it isn't even like that. Maybe I could work with both, and maybe this is what I asked for. Real sacrifice. I want it, but I don't need it, so I will give it up for you, Lord.
