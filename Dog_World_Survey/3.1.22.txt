If you have time to get sad, that probably means you have a little too much time on your hands. They don't lie when they tell you to seize the day, but you probably don't understand that. You're probably already convinced the day sucks. Suit yourself, but things won't be turning out great later when you reap what you sow. You should be busy, and the moment that you aren't busy anymore is then when you decide that you don't want to spend your free time pitying yourself to the tune of a Duster track. Now is the time to actually enjoy yourself, and to stop being a sorry sack of shit. You'll appreciate this insight when you're older, so kick back and enjoy your VeggieTales tunes cool dude B)
