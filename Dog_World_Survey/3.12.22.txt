I lie in my bed and soak in the quiet for a moment. No screaming college students or pointless A/C units, and no mildewy air or harsh synthetic lights. In the comfort of my bed I think about how my mother wants me to be comfortable, always worrying if I've had enough to eat or if I'm warm enough or if I take care of myself. This is her job, of course, but all the same I am not meant to be comfortable. I'm meant to feel the cold winter air against my body like Neil Perry before his suicide, because it is the only way to really suck out the marrow of life, a deliberate choice and a sign of living outside creature comfort. Moms and dads and principals and presidents wish well, but they serve a ruthless machine that believes in itself too much. This machine, on top of its own majority rule, squeezes and pressures against those who don't wish to conform, and kills any future against the machine. Authority by its nature will do this forever.
My phone goes off and I hope it's a text from Alaina, but it's just Duolingo, and I cuss out the green bird. I think about my priorities in life, of finding non-conformism and finding truth all the same, but it baffles me beyond my understanding. I think about my career choice, the teachers I hate, the people I've met who live more than me, and I think about my quiet hatred of the world. It'll kill me too. I'm not in a good state to write now, although I thought I was when I started. I'll try again tomorrow.
